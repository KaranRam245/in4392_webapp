 This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word, and a huge amount about the slang/profane uses. Perhaps the former should be extended; is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name? This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary.  

  
 i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipedia...IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very """"mean"""" word. i belive that is majorly true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog.  BITCH !!!!!!!!!It also stands for the name Brittany Fellowsâ€”Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢    

 ==etymology== 
 The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning """"female of the dog"""" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that """"the converse is equally possible."""" 
 The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  
 The verb meaning to complain in 1930. 
 Slang Bitchen """"good"""" is attested to the 1950's 

 == reclaiming the word bitch == 
 The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is """"pig"""", """"dog"""", """"cow"""" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to """"reclaim"""" as bitch simply means a female canine. 

 It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. 

    
 It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women """"reclaiming"""" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word """"bitch"""" any more than it reclaims the word """"sinner."""" 

 Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? 

 

 :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, """"She's a Bitch"""".   

 ::References are fine  just the name """"Missy Elliot"""" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned """"reclaiming"""" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   

 :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting """"querolous"""", """"spiteful"""", and """"malicious"""" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   

 ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   

 :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like """"bitch"""" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of """"bitch"""" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it.

 * don't overcategorized your article. Proornis to my knowledge is considered a basal bird and do not really fit in the dinosaur or coelurosaur categories.  
 * add references whenever possible 
 * start an article by defining the subject. For instance: """"Proornis"""" is an extinct genus of bird discovered in North Korea. 
 I hope you will be able to follow these guidelines when you will be creating a new article. If you need help, let me know.  """,32

The problem is that EFT doesn't show more of an effect than talking and tapping your arm or talking and tapping a doll.   

 :::Second, I think you're not being quite forthright when you describe the accupressure citations as """"controvert[ing] this conclusion"""".  In fact, you removed the last two and silently changed the other two.  If you want to change text that someone has already responded to, please use  and <\s>, like this, so it doesn't look like you're being sneaky.  This also looks like you're throwing in every citation you can find without reading or understanding them, hoping something will stick.  If you recall, I asked for one pdf and we're now at numbers 16 and 17 and you're just now learning what the issues are.  And, after taking a look, neither one of your new studies has anything to do with establishing the existence of """"energy systems in the body"""". 

 :::I'm not sure what to say at this point.  The most charitable interpretation I can come up with is that you're not reading what you're citing:  you're either cutting and pasting from google or some other source.  Alternatively you're reading all of these papers but have no understanding as to what they contain.  Either way, you might want to consider editing articles that better play to your strengths. 

 :::As to Feinstein's rejoinder:  it's available here.  This is an excellent lesson in tapdancing: 

 ::::[The studies he found] lend[] support for the efficacy  of tapping while mentally attuning to an emotional difficulty. Despite the design flaws found in some of the  studies, the preponderance of evidence shows energy psychology interventions to be efficacious. 

 :::The first sentence is true, but he neglects to explain why arm-tapping and doll-tapping have equal efficacy.  The second sentence equates talking and tapping with """"energy psychology"""" which has the additional baggage of energy fields that can evidently migrate to arms and dolls.   

 :::So after 18 citations what we have is the suggestion that a particular kind of talking associated with some sort of physical ritual can be more helpful than other treatments in some situations.  I would be comfortable including the two Feinstein reviews if the shortcomings pointed out in Pignotti are highlighted, and I think Waite (2003) deserves a paragraph.  I don't see an argument for including any of these other citations.  If you want to make such an argument, please be sure to read the citation first and be able to summarize how the citation supports the point you want to make.

 You wrote: 

 You will need to cite reliable sources for the assertions """"far too large to be chemical"""" and """"no endothermic storage events"""". I do not think any source can conclusively estabish either point . . . 

 It is very easy to establish both points, and there are hundreds of papers with proof of them. 

 1. The limits of chemical storage (electron bonds) are well understood. The most energy dense chemicals, such as gasoline, store 4 to 8 eV per atom. Cold fusion reactions have often produced far more than this, ranging from ~100 to ~100,000 eV per atom of the material in the cell, and in all cases there is no chemical fuel before the reaction, and no chemical ash after it finishes. Cell with a few grams of inert material in them have produced hundreds of megajoules of heat  as much as several kilograms of gasoline. if you were to burn the cell contents, they would produce only a tiny fraction of the heat. In fact, you could burn the cell, the table, and all books in the room and still get that much chemical energy. Therefore, chemistry is ruled out. 

 2. Any calorimeter can measure an endothermic event as accurately as it measures an exothermic event. For example, all calorimeters used in these studies show the endothermic formation of Pd-D at the beginning of the experiment. Since the calorimeters shows the exothermic excess heat, they would also show the endothermic storage that proceeds it. They have never done this. The heat balance is always zero before the heat bursts, and after.

  my comments follow, bluewillow991967 - 

 I'm sorry if I wasn't sufficiently clear.  

 On the specific subject of """"first serial"""" versus """"reprints"""" I have an interest because I write commercial fiction for a living. 

 I'm not saying a contract would contain a """"non-standard definition"""" of first serial, original, or reprint. 

 I'm saying that you quite clearly do not understand the *standard* definitions in publishing commercial fiction of first serial, original, and reprint. 

 """"Is"""" means the same thing in plain English as it does in intellectual property terminology. """"Reprint,"""" """"original"""" and """"first serial"""" mean much more specific things in intellectual property terminology than they do in colloquial English. 

 It may well be suitable to call a female crotch a vagina in a personal blog, but in an encyclopedia article talking about female genitalia, it matters that the colloquially used term is factually incorrect and the correct terminology should be used. If the correct terminology would be confusing to readers, then a hyperlink to a correct definition may be in order. 

 You are, by analogy, effectively insisting that a set of labia is a vagina. 

 (Sorry, clearest example I could think of where the commonly accepted vernacular term shouldn't be used in an encyclopedia article because it's wrong.)

Since he is so well-known as """"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,"""" the normal approach of dropping """"Dr."""" and keeping """"Ph.D."""" doesn't seem to be the best answer, even though it's the one most style guides seem to endorse.

 After a complaint at intervention against vandalism, I protected the article VampireFreaks.com.  It was either that, or block all of you for disruption and personal attacks.  I will unprotect the article in the morning.  In the meantime, please consider the following: 
 *Reverting another user's talk page is pretty rude.  There is a policy conflict between the user talk page policy, which says users can blank or archive warnings (although archiving is preferred by the community) and the vandalism policy, which says that removing warnings given to you is vandalism.  I don't agree with the vandalism point of view, and I haven't seen a lot of support for it lately except among people who are fighting amongst themselves for other reasons.  If someone deletes a warning they've obviously seen it.  If you are concerned about someone's edits, use a verbose edit summary so that even if the warning is removed the edit summary will be visible. 
 *I understand there is a view among two of you that Mrpainkiller7's edits are detrimental to the article.  There are lots of right ways to deal with this, including editing by consensus, Request for comment on the article or the user, Mediation, and third opinion.  I'm not going to judge the content, but fighting (wherever it occurs) is the wrong way to deal with the problem. 
 *Personal attacks are not to be tolerated.  Please deal with the content of edits, not character.  

 I'm leaving this message with each of you.  If you keep fighting over talk pages, I suppose I or another admin will eventually figure it's time to block someone.  Unless you are positive that you are 100% right and the other guy is 100% wrong, you should probably try and work this out peacefully in case the admins don't see things your way.",50

 *I've given this debate a bit of a read through, and for the most part, it seems clear that although the actual content of many of  may be important, they are presented in an extremely PoV manner that IMO smells agenda-pushing. Issues (ii) and (vii) below are prime examples of that, though the rest work as well. The key here that I think GoldDragon needs to understand (and trust me, I have experience with POV pushers) is that Wikipedia is not a place to campaign, all additions to the article need to be entirely factual and presented in a clearly neutral manner - something that  seems to have done well. GoldDragon's edits (specifically the ones identified as contentious in this discussion) should be reworked to be presented in a neutral manner, or else removed. In addition, this issue of what is notable enough for inclusion has come up often in my own disputes. The most useful tool I've come up with to deal with this is to ask myself """"Will the average, a-political Torontonian find this information useful?"""" Things like the election sign business for example; while interesting to those who are intensely involved, if you were to ask the average person, they'd probably say something along the lines of """"Who cares?""""

 ==US== 
 I'm trying not to just be a whinger and a hand waver here, but it annoys me that there's an entire section devoted to left vs. right politics in the US, yet there's nothing similar regarding the rest of the world. The US bias of wikipedia is very irritating sometimes, though it shouldn't be, as most Internet users are in the U.S. In other words, i'm a whiny European who is too lazy to write a non US section. 

 From the US>  That's easy to fix.  Start writing more about non-US views on topics, creating topics, and  getting your friends to help.  Something that is created by users being called biased only reflects the predominant users posting and thus can easily be remedied. 

 Also from the US> No, it's NOT so easy to fix. Throughout Wikipedia you will see entries from (obviously) American authors who have no concept of a world view and automatically write from a US perspective without any attempt to qualify their language. What, therefore, tends to happen is that the US view becomes a default with international views living in ghetto-ized paragraphs.     

 Also from the US> That is actually kind of the problem with Wikipedia all around in the first place, and that is that popular ideas are not necessarily correct. You can have people posting information about the corruptibility of whatever organization, but then the organization can have its people change the entry the next day.  â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by     

  
 This entire dicussion lends a great deal of credibilty to the idea that the left-right spectrum poorly represents political and economic views.  It seems to me that most of the debate below is equivalent to attempting to define the square root of negative 1 with only real numbers at our disposal.  It is painfully obvious that politics is muli-dimensional.  The most that can be hoped for here is to describe how the left-right spectrum is used and leave it at that.  This should probably be a very short article.  â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 == Better Chart == 

 I think that this page needs a metter chart. Like this one http://studentnewsdaily.com/conservative_vs_liberal_beliefs.shtml    

  
 Edit  

 I actually think that the article, in fact the whole political movement, needs a better definition of """"left-right"""". Most political parties cannot adhere to a single category, including revolutionnary movements and far-right groups, as described somewhere else in the discussion. 

 I suggest a new use of the """"left-right"""" compass. 

 The political compass uses the """"square"""" system with two axis  x and y (social and Ã©conomic), which is not very accurate because I know my political ideas, and they tend to be pretty nearer to Mussolini than to Gandhi. Whatever. 

 What I suggest is a cube! 

 3 axis  x, y and z 

 Ã‰conomic 
 Social 
 Politic 

 The first one defines the market system (if any) of a political group. 
 The second defines the social standing of a political group about the welfare of the people (welfare checks/charity, private/public school/medical system, etc) 
 The thirds one is, basically, the way a society treats it's people (rehabilitation/punishment, democracy/totaliratism (in which I include Soviet Communism!) etc)

Does that reduce my credibility, probably yes ha?). I am sory to give this description but I get the impression that i will soon be blamed of beeing a Turkish propagandist, goverment person, racist whatever. Am I too sensitive. No take a look at the discussion history and see that these accusations are there.    
 I am making clear points that any sane unbiased human cam make. First of all the article issues the Genocide as a fact! A fact but with still some discussions (most of them being from the Turkish goverment). This gives the inevitible impression that all issiue is largely accepted(final verdict). Yet it is not!!!  
 Secondly the term Genocide can only be used under certain conditions (as in the holocoust). in this case there is a real doubt if these conditions are met!!! still the article freely and carelessly uses the term just only because some people or countries recogonise it that way. Do we have the right to blame a nation with this ultimate crime just because of that??? Genocide guys this is no joke!!! tell it 100 times for 90 years and Turks are Genociders! Cool! 
 third: after building up the genocide idea The article mainly represents the opposing view as the view of the Turkish goverment as clearly described by the headings (the position of Turkey,the position of Turkish authorities, political issues) as well as the content. which inevitibly gives the impression that the opposing view is just bull S*** Turkish propaganda. But it is not! Many Prof. and researcher of the era say that it is not. (As seen in the attached letter). yet fadix wrote that these prof were actually accepting the genocide they were fooled in to this (quoting Israel Charny). this is ridiculous. I dont know who the hell is Israel Charny or he really claims something like that. But please we are not stupid people. this was a letter to the representatives and these people who signed it are Profs. for gods sake!!! also If these prof were in favor of the genocide and really fooled in this conspiracy later they would have said """"ok guys I am misslead and fooled into this"""" and this would be the ultimate tool for Armenian side too ridicule and discredit the Turkish side. Is it the case? No!(so fadix what about credibility) 

 I am not bitching anyone. I am not using citations and names to blurr peoples mind. if you read my previous adds you will see that i am trying to use a carefull language. I am sorry again if I used harsh words. But after reading the long history of discussion in this page I have the impression that Fadix (who seems to be the main edittor in this page)has a certain attitude towards the issue and despite serious oppsition now and in the past he is just pushing the article his way.  

 ok Fadix I believe in your good faith. I am a dumb ass who doesnt know any thing about history .please give me answers. I am just asking plain, crystal clear questions. I dont want to hear citations, dates and historian names. just logical anwers!! Just logical answers which will show that you are unbiased!!! Or you may choose to say I believe in Armenian genocide and that is why I chose to ignore... 

 1. how can you use the nomenclature or lets say the word """"genocide"""" so easily knowing that it is desribed and only can be declared by international law. also knowing that there is robust objections to the usage of this term. Are you the ultimate expert. Are you the head of an international court?(if yes where is self defence?)  ((you say Go try finding such a section in the Cambodian genocide article, the Nanking massacre article, Rwanda genocide article. I could not see a Cambodian genocide article, in Rwanda genocide: United Nations set up the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, so the guild is described by law. Nanking massacre is a perfect example!!! why is it not called a genocide but massacre? is it because the guilt is not described by law??!! and in the discussion there is no real objection to the issue accept the numbers) 

 2. why does the article present the genocide as a fact? (I hope you wont tell that it doesnt). why do you build up the article so that people are first instructed that there is indeed a genocide and only later show the objetions. 

 3. why is there no data about armenian gangs killing muslims and raiding villages before and after 191",51

 == Revision of a paragraph in mind-body section == 

 The following paragraph appears in the section on mind-body problem 
 ::Incompatibilism requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Although  substance dualism offers such a distinction, a less extreme form of naturalism known as non-reductive physicalism may also suffice. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states correspond to neurological states. Under non-reductive physicalism, although physical states do cause mental states, they are not ontologically reducible to them. In one such construction, mental events supervene on physical events, describing the emergence of mental properties as correspondent to physical properties. This relationship is known as causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as property dualism rather than monism, yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states - such as epiphenomenalism. 

 I understand the urge to recast the preceding discussion in a form more similar to the rest of the article. But I don't find this paragraph, although superior to its predecessor, has quite made the grade. I'd like to try to do this in a manner reverse to that of the paragraph; that is, go from the simple viewpoint to the technical rather than vice versa. A single paragraph won't do it. Here is a possible substitute (please take it as a suggestion to be tinkered with): 
 ::One may choose as a starting point the point of view that mind and matter constitute different things. One may then take several views about how or even whether they interact. At one extreme there is no interaction at all. At another extreme, mind completely controls matter or the other way around. In between, one may say mind and matter each influence each other to a degree, in some cases one is more in control and sometimes the other. 
 ::We might attempt to establish which of these choices is best, but that seems to be out of reach at the moment. Instead, we will simply connect these possibilities with various identifying labels of historical importance.  If one takes the extreme view that mind completely controls matter, or vice versa, in effect the controlled aspect is simply an appendage of the controlling aspect, and may be considered simply as a property of the controlling aspect. The two substances are then simply one, albeit perhaps with some additional attributes, and this viewpoint is called monism, which takes on several forms as described in that Wikipedia article.  
 ::An example, is epiphenomenalism, that mind is just a peculiar side effect of matter. Thomas Huxley described the relation between mind and matter as follows: 
 :: 
 ::Huxley goes on to say he sees no difference from humans in this regard. Very similar to this point of view is reductive physicalism adopted by some neuroscientists: 
 ::{{quote|...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells... |Eric R. Kandel|In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind}} 
 ::The view that mind and matter are different is called dualism, and it again takes on several forms described in that Wikipedia article. Within this description are various degrees of control of one entity over the other, ranging from complete autonomy of one or both entities, to some degree of interdependence. Considerable interest attaches as to what forms of interdependence might arise. 
 ::For example, even if mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states bear some correspondence with neurological states. Under non-reductive physicalism, physical states do cause'' mental states, but they are not ontologically reducible to them. In one such construction, mental events exhibit emergence from physical propertie",51

 ::You can keep a record of whatever you want on your own talk page. Per the talk page guidelines you can not use the talk page of the article to do so, as  correctly told you. Your last edit as well goes against the guidelines. I suggest you read them after removing the section from the article. Regards.

 Could you take a look at the revised Deepak Kamani article?    

 I was asked to come back and reconsider - There have been edits additions from   - it still looks like an attack story, it looks more like an attack story after the  changes - I can not change my position to require removal from publication    

 ==  Calling the First Minister an Arsehole == 

 I put the story back ,the truth hurts ? I guess you need Â£ 8,000 really badly 

 I have now put it back again and will continue to do so every time you remobve it 

 You need to try and understand that the wikipedia entry is public property ,you don't own it . 

 :I really don't care about this truth, in fact I agree completely with Mike Daily. You  need to understand that this wiki has rules and you are not following them. FYI I wouldn't qualify FOR THE 8000 euro minimum wage    

 you may not care about the truth ,some of us do 

 NO NEED TO SHOUT

 Hi, I only tried to add education info to the article. I don't think there is any contenscious in the info I added? I apologise for messing up the references when editing- I think these are ok no",51

 It's not that I'm particularly concerned about the loss of , but did you really need to step in and hardblock there? 

 I saw the test edits. I saw the username that, while not violating any particular part of policy, managed to be an astoundingly bad choice of username anyway. I responded to these issues with the warning I felt was appropriate, feeling that the user could have a second chance under a less moronic username. 

 Yes, I am more patient with newbies who screw up than you are. We can each have our own approach to adminship. But I don't unblock and warn noobs you've just hardblocked, so how about you don't hardblock noobs I've just warned? 

 And if this was just an oversight, that's fine. Again, it is unlikely that Wikipedia will suffer from the loss of this user.",51
